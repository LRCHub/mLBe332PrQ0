My own ominous stone
Tells me I'm not alone
It says ask another question
Each word, for what it's worth
Says she's not of this Earth
It tells me ask one more question
It's cold and dark outside your spell
It's cold and dark out here as well
I know it's here
You know I can hear it
Your evil spirit
The sermon ---
Forms circles all 'round me
They tell me
Ask one more question
True love, let me in
Teach the wages of sin
Then ask me just one more question
It's cold and dark outside your spell
It's cold and dark out here as well
I know it's here
You know I can hear it
Your evil spirit
It's cold and dark outside your spell
