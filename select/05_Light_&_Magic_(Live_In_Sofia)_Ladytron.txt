The kids are freed, now all they need
Is a gift from their mum and dad
They heard the tones of Spanish phones
Stranded in the sand

You left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
You left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
Left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
Light and magic

You cut your hair and made a friend
Now they're falling into you
This is the closest that you will get to them
How do you do?

You left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
Switched off your voicemail
And left it alone
Left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
Light and magic

Then lost some time in someone's line
Might just've caught the show
This is not real but it will deal with
This thing between tonight and tomorrow

You left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
You left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
Left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
Light and magic

By the beach in a one-storey building
You're lucky if the light's not out
But, baby, now you look like a xerox
Of yourself

Left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
Left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
Left on the lights
Is there somebody home?
Light and magic

The kids are freed, now all they need
Is a gift from their mum and dad
They heard the tones of Spanish phones
Stranded in the sand

Light and magic
Light and magic
Light and magic
